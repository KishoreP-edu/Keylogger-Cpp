What is a Keylogger?

A keylogger is a type of monitoring software designed to record keystrokes made by a user on their keyboard. This data can be used to capture sensitive information like passwords, personal messages, and other confidential data. Keyloggers can be implemented in software or hardware and are often used maliciously to steal information. However, they also have legitimate uses in security research and monitoring authorized activity.
